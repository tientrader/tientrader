## 👨‍💻 About Me

- I'm a **Backend Software Engineer** who believes that delivering a feature is only one part of the job. True engineering is about building high-performance, scalable, resilient, and secure systems with high availability, effective monitoring, and robust error handling.

- Every line of code, every design decision, is guided by principles that ensure not only meeting the requirements but also creating systems that are robust and sustainable.
